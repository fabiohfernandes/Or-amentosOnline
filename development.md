# Development Progress - OrÃ§amentosOnline

**Project:** AI-Driven Commercial Proposal Platform
**Domain:** infigital.net
**Repository:** D:\OrÃ§amentosOnline
**Started:** December 25, 2024

---

## Project Overview

OrÃ§amentosOnline is an AI-powered platform that streamlines the entire commercial proposal lifecycle from creation to contract signature. The platform enables businesses to import designs from third-party tools (Canva, Gamma), collaborate with clients in real-time, and automatically generate contracts upon approval.

### Key Features Planned:
- **Seamless Import**: Direct integration with design tools (Canva, Gamma)
- **AI-Enhanced Editing**: Real-time content and media optimization
- **Client Collaboration**: Private, secure proposal review and feedback system
- **Automated Contracting**: Instant contract generation and digital signature
- **Dynamic Hosting**: Auto-generated subdomains for each proposal
- **Multi-channel Notifications**: Email, WhatsApp, and Telegram integration

## Key Decisions & Learnings

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Chose MAESTRO system with 3 crews (Alpha Discovery, Beta Delivery, Gamma Excellence)
2. **Containerization**: All services must be Docker containerized (per CLAUDE.md guidelines)
3. **Brazilian-First Design**: All agents incorporate LGPD compliance and local market understanding
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Mandatory approval gates before phase transitions

### Development Methodology
- **Vibe Coding**: Rapid, taste-driven iteration balancing speed and craft
- **Evidence-Based**: All decisions require citations and supporting evidence
- **Transparency**: Never lie about development progress, always show true feature status
- **Educational Approach**: Assume user is not experienced coder, provide teaching and guidance

### Quality Standards Established
- **Test Coverage**: > 80% unit tests, > 70% integration tests
- **Security**: Zero critical/high vulnerabilities in scans
- **Performance**: Sub-3-second loading times globally
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
- **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and runbooks required

---

## Risk Management

### Current Risks Identified
1. **Technical Complexity**: Multi-agent coordination complexity may impact delivery timelines
2. **Third-Party Dependencies**: Reliance on Canva, Gamma, OpenAI APIs for core functionality
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Brazilian LGPD and international privacy requirements
4. **User Adoption**: Educational curve for non-technical users

### Mitigation Strategies
- Progressive enhancement approach with fallback options
- Multiple provider fallbacks for critical APIs
- Built-in compliance framework from project start
- Extensive user guidance and educational content

---

## Team & Resources

### Multi-Agent System Available
- **MAESTRO**: Central orchestrator (operational)
- **Alpha Crew**: 10 Research & Planning specialists
- **Beta Crew**: 20+ Design & Implementation specialists
- **Gamma Crew**: 8+ Quality, Security & Compliance specialists
- **Specialized Units**: 40+ additional domain experts across 6 categories

### Technology Stack Ready
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js with PWA capabilities
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express or Python/Django (microservices)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis, S3, Elasticsearch
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI API, Nano Banana API, custom ML models
- **Infrastructure**: AWS services with Docker containerization

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **User Decision**: Choose specific Phase 1 feature to begin implementation
2. **Environment Setup**: Create containerized development environment
3. **GitHub Repository**: Establish remote repository connection
4. **Phase 1 Planning**: Detailed breakdown of first implementation cycle

### User Approval Needed
Per CLAUDE.md guidelines, awaiting user confirmation to proceed to Phase 1 implementation. All foundation work is complete and the multi-agent system is ready for coordination.
